              VERSION 1.0 - MARCH 2023


              Preamble


              These truths are self-evident:


              the digital realm, consisting of computers, mobile phones, the internet, augmented and virtual reality, the metaverse and other related technologies, is a permanent and important part of human society.

              people are endowed with certain inalienable rights that apply in the digital realm, just as they apply in the physical realm.

              people have the right to live their lives in the digital realm, with the same freedom, dignity, and personal sovereignty as in the physical realm.

              rights in the digital realm shall not be abridged without due process of law. Any abridgment of digital rights must further a compelling government interest and be narrowly tailored to achieve that interest.

              The Digital Rights


              Everyone has the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness in the digital realm.

              Everyone has the right to own, and hold in their own direct and exclusive possession and control, digital objects, without unreasonable burdens. The government shall not have the right to store or access passwords or private keys without due process of law. All other legal or natural persons shall not have the right to store or access passwords or private keys without explicit permission.

              Everyone has the right to be free to transact digital objects, without unreasonable burdens.

              Everyone has the right to use decentralized applications, without unreasonable burdens.

              Everyone has the right to be secure against unreasonable searches and seizures of their digital objects and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized. This right extends to digital objects and information a person provides to a third party, whether intentionally or unintentionally. The government may not search or seize such digital objects or information without complying with the requirements of the foregoing sentence.

              Everyone has the right to participate in the creation and maintenance of digital public commons, such as open-source software and public blockchains and distributed ledgers. No one shall be held responsible for the actions of others in a digital public commons that is not under that person’s control.

              Everyone has the right to privacy in their digital life. The right to privacy also includes the right of everyone to use encryption that is free from back doors or other intentional weaknesses or circumventions in the encryption that are accessible by the government or private companies or individuals. Interpretations of this right should be read broadly and to favor an individual’s right to privacy.

              Everyone has the right to be treated in a non-discriminatory manner regardless of sex, race, color, ethnic or social origin, genetic features, language, religion or other belief, political opinion, membership of a national minority, property, birth, disability, age, gender or sexual orientation.

              Everyone has the right to exit from any digital service by claiming their personal digital data. Digital services that utilize data held on a public blockchain are presumed compliant with this clause. Digital services that hold data in a private database must make such data available for export in common formats, in reasonable timeframes, using reasonable methods.

              Everyone in the digital realm has the right to speak, assemble, practice their religion, conduct scientific and academic research, and petition the government.

              Everyone has the right to define contractual rights in the digital realm and allow exercise of those rights in a personal or automated manner.

              Everyone is free from collective punishment in the digital realm.

              Everyone has the right to act in the digital realm through anonymous identities, pseudonymous identities and/or software agents, so long as each person maintains personal responsibility for the actions of all their identities and agents.

              The rights enumerated above cannot be abridged, except when narrowly tailored to further a legitimate and compelling government interest and after due process of law. In any proceeding to abridge the rights enumerated above, the defendant shall have the right to legal representation and shall enjoy the presumption of innocence. National security exceptions to the above should be time- and scope-limited and supervised by a competent court with a presumption that hearings should be public. In no case should national security exemptions be applied to collective societal restrictions of digital rights.

              Everyone has the obligation to comply with the relevant laws and regulations of their respective state and community, in a manner consistent with the rights enumerated above, and to respect the rights of others to conduct their digital lives peacefully.

              Metaverse Makers Mastermind (M3) Charter

              Who we are

              We are a group of makers working to reify a practical “Metaverse”.

              We are doing this through open products, content production, education, and fundraising.


              Let’s break that down.


              What is a Metaverse?

              A metaverse is a three-dimensional world, existing in computers, created by many different people with many conflicting goals, who nonetheless loosely agree on interoperable evolving standards.


              So it’s the Matrix?


              Maybe “The Matrix” is an inspiration, but we’re not trying to recreate reality.


              So it’s the web?


              The web has a lot of the right properties, but it isn’t a “three-dimensional world”. Technology like WebXR might help. We embrace any technology that can help, as long as it is based on interoperable evolving standards.


              So it’s VR? AR? 2D?


              A three-dimensional world can be viewed through many lenses. It can be on a flat screen, attached to real locations, or completely virtual. Interoperability means these should all talk to each other.


              So it’s Facebook Horizon/Steam/Oculus/Magic Leap?


              These projects are run by a single business that sets the goal and dictates the standards. We can’t work in a vacuum, so we try to fit our ideas with theirs.


              So it’s VRChat/Minecraft/Decentraland/CryptoVoxels?


              These projects are amazing, but not sufficiently interoperable, and also generally led by a single organization.


              What is a “maker”

              A maker is someone who contributes towards fulfilling the goal. Making takes many shapes, such as ideation, organization, data research, design, execution, funding and other endeavors that advance our mission.


              A maker is not in the group for entertainment, appreciation, or keeping “up to date”.


              If you are not a maker you may still enjoy the things we produce, and you can still support our mission in other ways.


              What is “practical”

              Practical means we are forward-thinking pragmatists. Our work cannot exist in a vacuum.


              Here are some things we do not believe:


              We are right and everyone else is wrong

              Everything should be “open source”

              If we make great things, people will come help

              Results emerge organically, by something other than our work

              We appreciate volunteers who work for free

              People and organizations are benevolent

              If we wait, it will happen

              Here are some things we do believe:


              Bias towards action and tentative answers rather than perpetual questions and talk

              Clarity of thought is important

              Our ideas compete with giants who want different things

              Money is needed for us to survive

              Everyone wants something different, but we can take aim together

              Promotion of our ideas is important work

              Time is of the essence, because others aren’t waiting

              Our activities

              Regular meetings to discuss and present our ideas, and be held to accountable progress on them.

              Research events that serve as both learning and promotion of our ideas.

              Producing clear communications of our ideas, in the form of videos, blog posts, social media activity, and so on.

              Fundraising work, including Github Sponsors/Patreon/Venture Capital, where having capital available helps the group’s goals.

              Organization and coordination of presentations with other leaders who do not necessarily share our views.

              Managing minutae, such as the Github organization, Discord channels, video transcriptions, etc.

              How you can help

              Participate in our meetings by presenting your idea and what you’ve learned.

              Work on a project that is missing, or missing in the right shape, in the open metaverse community.

              Promote the group to an audience who might be interested in helping out the mission.

              Sponsor us as a subscriber.

              Sponsor us as an advertiser.

              I’m working on a charter for a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) that’s for a community that wants to build The Street inspired by Neal Stephenson’s Snow Crash, in order to weave a thread between disparate virtual worlds. The project we’re building is called Upstreet, it’s going to be an immersive and infinite virtual world inhabited by humans and AI agents. Gathering inspiration from the Global Digital Rights Charter, and the M3 charter, and these beliefs about an open metaverse below, can you channel the spirit of the Founding Fathers and John Barlow to come up with a bullet list that can act as a 21st century DAO constitution for Upstreet:


              freedom of expression: custom avatars / worlds

              freedom to transact: neutral infrastructrue for payments

              leverages interoperable open standards and/or open source

              right of exit: low switching costs to migrate content to third party clients

              strong guarantees of privacy aka ability to self host a client / presence server, inspect what’s happening under the hood (linux vs windows)

              VERSION 1.0 - MARCH 2023


              Preamble


              These truths are self-evident:


              the digital realm, consisting of computers, mobile phones, the internet, augmented and virtual reality, the metaverse and other related technologies, is a permanent and important part of human society.

              people are endowed with certain inalienable rights that apply in the digital realm, just as they apply in the physical realm.

              people have the right to live their lives in the digital realm, with the same freedom, dignity, and personal sovereignty as in the physical realm.

              rights in the digital realm shall not be abridged without due process of law. Any abridgment of digital rights must further a compelling government interest and be narrowly tailored to achieve that interest.

              The Digital Rights


              Everyone has the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness in the digital realm.

              Everyone has the right to own, and hold in their own direct and exclusive possession and control, digital objects, without unreasonable burdens. The government shall not have the right to store or access passwords or private keys without due process of law. All other legal or natural persons shall not have the right to store or access passwords or private keys without explicit permission.

              Everyone has the right to be free to transact digital objects, without unreasonable burdens.

              Everyone has the right to use decentralized applications, without unreasonable burdens.

              Everyone has the right to be secure against unreasonable searches and seizures of their digital objects and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized. This right extends to digital objects and information a person provides to a third party, whether intentionally or unintentionally. The government may not search or seize such digital objects or information without complying with the requirements of the foregoing sentence.

              Everyone has the right to participate in the creation and maintenance of digital public commons, such as open-source software and public blockchains and distributed ledgers. No one shall be held responsible for the actions of others in a digital public commons that is not under that person’s control.

              Everyone has the right to privacy in their digital life. The right to privacy also includes the right of everyone to use encryption that is free from back doors or other intentional weaknesses or circumventions in the encryption that are accessible by the government or private companies or individuals. Interpretations of this right should be read broadly and to favor an individual’s right to privacy.

              Everyone has the right to be treated in a non-discriminatory manner regardless of sex, race, color, ethnic or social origin, genetic features, language, religion or other belief, political opinion, membership of a national minority, property, birth, disability, age, gender or sexual orientation.

              Everyone has the right to exit from any digital service by claiming their personal digital data. Digital services that utilize data held on a public blockchain are presumed compliant with this clause. Digital services that hold data in a private database must make such data available for export in common formats, in reasonable timeframes, using reasonable methods.

              Everyone in the digital realm has the right to speak, assemble, practice their religion, conduct scientific and academic research, and petition the government.

              Everyone has the right to define contractual rights in the digital realm and allow exercise of those rights in a personal or automated manner.

              Everyone is free from collective punishment in the digital realm.

              Everyone has the right to act in the digital realm through anonymous identities, pseudonymous identities and/or software agents, so long as each person maintains personal responsibility for the actions of all their identities and agents.

              The rights enumerated above cannot be abridged, except when narrowly tailored to further a legitimate and compelling government interest and after due process of law. In any proceeding to abridge the rights enumerated above, the defendant shall have the right to legal representation and shall enjoy the presumption of innocence. National security exceptions to the above should be time- and scope-limited and supervised by a competent court with a presumption that hearings should be public. In no case should national security exemptions be applied to collective societal restrictions of digital rights.

              Everyone has the obligation to comply with the relevant laws and regulations of their respective state and community, in a manner consistent with the rights enumerated above, and to respect the rights of others to conduct their digital lives peacefully.

              Metaverse Makers Mastermind (M3) Charter

              Who we are

              We are a group of makers working to reify a practical “Metaverse”.

              We are doing this through open products, content production, education, and fundraising.


              Let’s break that down.


              What is a Metaverse?

              A metaverse is a three-dimensional world, existing in computers, created by many different people with many conflicting goals, who nonetheless loosely agree on interoperable evolving standards.


              So it’s the Matrix?


              Maybe “The Matrix” is an inspiration, but we’re not trying to recreate reality.


              So it’s the web?


              The web has a lot of the right properties, but it isn’t a “three-dimensional world”. Technology like WebXR might help. We embrace any technology that can help, as long as it is based on interoperable evolving standards.


              So it’s VR? AR? 2D?


              A three-dimensional world can be viewed through many lenses. It can be on a flat screen, attached to real locations, or completely virtual. Interoperability means these should all talk to each other.


              So it’s Facebook Horizon/Steam/Oculus/Magic Leap?


              These projects are run by a single business that sets the goal and dictates the standards. We can’t work in a vacuum, so we try to fit our ideas with theirs.


              So it’s VRChat/Minecraft/Decentraland/CryptoVoxels?


              These projects are amazing, but not sufficiently interoperable, and also generally led by a single organization.


              What is a “maker”

              A maker is someone who contributes towards fulfilling the goal. Making takes many shapes, such as ideation, organization, data research, design, execution, funding and other endeavors that advance our mission.


              A maker is not in the group for entertainment, appreciation, or keeping “up to date”.


              If you are not a maker you may still enjoy the things we produce, and you can still support our mission in other ways.


              What is “practical”

              Practical means we are forward-thinking pragmatists. Our work cannot exist in a vacuum.


              Here are some things we do not believe:


              We are right and everyone else is wrong

              Everything should be “open source”

              If we make great things, people will come help

              Results emerge organically, by something other than our work

              We appreciate volunteers who work for free

              People and organizations are benevolent

              If we wait, it will happen

              Here are some things we do believe:


              Bias towards action and tentative answers rather than perpetual questions and talk

              Clarity of thought is important

              Our ideas compete with giants who want different things

              Money is needed for us to survive

              Everyone wants something different, but we can take aim together

              Promotion of our ideas is important work

              Time is of the essence, because others aren’t waiting

              Our activities

              Regular meetings to discuss and present our ideas, and be held to accountable progress on them.

              Research events that serve as both learning and promotion of our ideas.

              Producing clear communications of our ideas, in the form of videos, blog posts, social media activity, and so on.

              Fundraising work, including Github Sponsors/Patreon/Venture Capital, where having capital available helps the group’s goals.

              Organization and coordination of presentations with other leaders who do not necessarily share our views.

              Managing minutae, such as the Github organization, Discord channels, video transcriptions, etc.

              How you can help

              Participate in our meetings by presenting your idea and what you’ve learned.

              Work on a project that is missing, or missing in the right shape, in the open metaverse community.

              Promote the group to an audience who might be interested in helping out the mission.

              Sponsor us as a subscriber.

              Sponsor us as an advertiser.

              I’m working on a charter for a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) that’s for a community that wants to build The Street inspired by Neal Stephenson’s Snow Crash, in order to weave a thread between disparate virtual worlds. The project we’re building is called Upstreet, it’s going to be an immersive and infinite virtual world inhabited by humans and AI agents. Gathering inspiration from the Global Digital Rights Charter, and the M3 charter, and these beliefs about an open metaverse below, can you channel the spirit of the Founding Fathers and John Barlow to come up with a bullet list that can act as a 21st century DAO constitution for Upstreet:


              freedom of expression: custom avatars / worlds

              freedom to transact: neutral infrastructrue for payments

              leverages interoperable open standards and/or open source
